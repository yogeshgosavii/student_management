# Student management system  

This project is a web application developed using **Java Spring Boot**, a powerful framework for creating scalable and maintainable applications. It also leverages **Thymeleaf** as the templating engine to provide dynamic, server-side rendering of content with seamless integration into the Spring MVC architecture.  

## Features  
- **Spring Boot Framework**: Provides a robust backend framework with built-in configurations for streamlined development.  
- **Thymeleaf Templating**: Ensures dynamic content rendering with clean and maintainable templates.  
- **Scalability**: Built to handle future growth with modular architecture.  
- **Integration-ready**: Can be easily connected with various databases and external services.  

## Technology Stack  
- **Backend**: Java Spring Boot  
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf templating  
- **Database**: (Specify your database, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL)  
- **Build Tool**: Maven/Gradle (Specify which youâ€™re using)  

## Prerequisites  
- Java 11 or higher  
- Maven or Gradle (based on your build tool)  
- (Add any other prerequisites, like a specific database or IDE)
